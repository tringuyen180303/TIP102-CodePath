"""Problem 7: Gossip Chain
In Hollywood, rumors spread rapidly among celebrities through various connections. Imagine each celebrity is represented as a vertex in a directed graph, and the connections between them are directed edges indicating who spread the latest gossip to whom.

The arrival time of a rumor for a given celebrity is the moment the rumor reaches them for the first time, and the departure time is when all the celebrities they could influence have already heard the rumor, meaning they are no longer involved in spreading it.

Given a list of edges connections representing connections between celebrities and the number of celebrities in the the graph n, find the arrival and departure time of the rumor for each celebrity in a Depth First Search (DFS) starting from a given celebrity start.

Return a dictionary where each celebrity in connections is a key whose corresponding value is a tuple (arrival_time, departure_time) representing the arrival and departure times of the rumor for that celebrity. If a celebrity never hears the rumor their arrival and departure times should be (-1, -1).
